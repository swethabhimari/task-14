<h1>JAVA</h1>
<P>Java is a widely used object-oriented programming language and software platform that runs on billions of devices, including notebook computers, mobile devices, gaming consoles,
   medical devices and many others. The rules and syntax of Java are based on the C and C++ languages.The main ideas behind Java's Object-Oriented Programming, OOP concepts include
   abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Basically, Java OOP concepts let us create working methods and variables, then re-use all or part of them without compromising security.<h2>What is Java?</h2>
   Java is a widely used object-oriented programming language and software platform that runs on billions of devices, including notebook computers, mobile devices, gaming consoles, medical devices and many others. The rules and syntax of Java are based on the C and C++ languages.
   
   One major advantage of developing software with Java is its portability. Once you wrote code for a Java program on a notebook computer, it can be easily moved to a mobile device. When the language was invented in 1991 by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems (later acquired by Oracle), the primary goal was to be able to "write once, run anywhere."
   
   It's also important to understand that Java is much different from JavaScript. JavaScript does not need to be compiled, while Java code needs to be. Also, Javascript only runs on web browsers, while Java can be run anywhere.
   
   New and improved software development tools are coming to the market at a remarkable pace, displacing incumbent products once thought to be indispensable. In light of this continual turnover, Java’s longevity is impressive; more than two decades after its creation, Java is still the most popular language for application software development. Developers continue to choose it over languages such as Python, Ruby, PHP, Swift, C++ and others. As a result, Java remains to be an important requirement for competing in the job market.

<p><h1>The state of welfare: India’s budget 2024–25</h2>As India accelerates towards becoming the third largest global economy, its growth is marked by increasing inequality. The post-pandemic recovery has been uneven and characterised by a K-shaped growth trajectory, where certain segments of the population experience rapid growth while others face economic decline. Governments must establish robust socio-economic safety nets to ensure inclusive and equitable growth. This responsibility is not only a moral imperative but also a constitutional duty and obligation of the Indian state.

    The implementation of comprehensive welfare programmes, targeted subsidies, and improved access to essential services such as quality healthcare and education are crucial for promoting social justice and ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are distributed equitably.
    
    Union Budgets serve as a critical indicator of the government’s intentions, priorities, and policy objectives. They not only shape the economic and social landscape of the country but also provide insight into the nation’s governance.</p>

<h1>How does Budget 2024 address climate change?</h1>
<p>From prioritising energy security to allocations for flood management, the 2024 Union Budget takes steps to address climate concerns. But does it do enough?</p>
<p>Tackling climate-change driven challenges found mention in the Union Budget 2024-25 presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23. The budget pushes for energy security in several ways including building small nuclear energy reactors. Ways to tackle climate events also found place in it, with the central government’s proposal to fund research and development in climate-resistant crops, and managing floods in some states in the north. 

    However, on most other counts, the budget overlooked the environment. Some experts said that it will remain to be seen how much policy is translated into action; others called it a “lack-lustre” budget that “wants [for] imagination”.</p>

<h1>Geopolitical Implications of the Liquefied Natural Gas Permitting Pause</h1>
<p>On January 26, 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced that it would be temporarily pausing its review of all liquified natural gas (LNG) export applications to non-free trade agreement countries. DOE justified the pause by claiming that it needed to review, and possibly alter, the process for analyzing economic and environmental impacts of all future projects seeking approval for exporting to European and Asian markets. After many months of uncertainty and unclear direction from DOE, on July 1, 2024, Judge James Cain of the Federal District Court in Louisiana issued a preliminary injunction against the temporary LNG permitting pause—upholding a stay request from 16 states. In the long term, however, the fate of the permitting pause may depend on the 2024 election results; in the event of a Harris presidency, the pause is likely to continue, while in the case of a Trump presidency it’s likely to cease.</p>

<h1>Jordan Peterson’s Technicolor Dreamcoats</h1>
<p>In recent times, few figures have provoked as much fascination, conversation and consternation as Jordan Peterson. A professor of psychology turned cultural revolutionary, Peterson’s ascent to prominence has been nothing short of meteoric, propelled by his controversial views on gender, free speech and the human condition. The next phase of his career development is apparently at hand; we now seem to be witnessing the transformation of a mild-mannered shrink into a modern-day Moses.

    The 61-year-old has, in recent times, decided to dip his toes into the vast sea of biblical scholarship. Long gone are the days of dissecting lobsters and giving advice to young men on how to clean their rooms. Today’s Jordan Peterson is unraveling the mysteries of the Old Testament like a seasoned biblical scholar. Though he’s not quite ready to commit to a simple yes or no on the question of God’s existence, he seems to be positioning himself as an authority on religious teachings and philosophical musings.</p>

    <h1>How the Supreme Court’s Big Gun Cases Played Out</h1>
    <p>The Supreme Court delivered two major gun decisions this term, and while both will have significant effects on American gun policy, we should watch for those impacts to happen on different timelines.

    First, the court tossed out a ban on bump stocks—a ban instituted after the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, in which a lone gunman killed 60 people and injured more than 400. The gunman used weapons fitted with the special stocks, which enabled the guns to fire rounds at a more rapid pace. 
    
    In Cargill v. Garland, a 6-3 majority found the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) exceeded its authority when reclassifying bump stocks as machine guns because they didn’t fit the definition provided in the underlying law. “In any event, Congress could have linked the definition of ‘machinegun’ to a weapon’s rate of fire, as the dissent would prefer,” Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the majority. “But, it instead enacted a statute that turns on whether a weapon can fire more than one shot ‘automatically ... by a single function of the trigger.’ And, ‘it is never our job to rewrite ... statutory text under the banner of speculation about what Congress might have done.’”</p>
